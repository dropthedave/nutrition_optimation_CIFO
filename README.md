## Problem Description
The Stigler Diet problem describes a mathematical way to solve basic nutritional needs in an inexpensive way. While this topic is still very relevant, the problem framework is slightly outdated. This project aims to provide a new and modern approach on the problem using openly available data from the fast food chain “McDonalds” in order to find the cheapest constellation of items on the menu, which can fulfill the daily nutritional needs.

## Repo Informations
**Two Data Files:**
- McDonaldsMenuData.csv
- Data.py

We only use Data.py to import the Data into our notebook/scripts

**Python Scripts:**
- fitness.py
- individual.py
- population.py
- selection.py
- variation.py

**Evaluation Notebook:**
- evaluation_notebook_Group2.ipynb

For a more convenient comparison, we decided to evaluate the different algorithms in a final notebook
